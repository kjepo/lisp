# explicit LISP

This is an exercise in building a LISP machine.

The code in `explicit.scm` is a register machine implementation
of a LISP interpreter. Rather than the usual recursive apply/eval
description of the interpreter, we have made the control and
arguments explicit.  The code is based on SICP, chapter 5 (and forwards).

The goal is now to write the same code in C (file `lisp.c`).
The code is not finished yet but the goal is to get the interpreter
running and then add some sort of garbage collection.
